    <h1>This is header</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    <strong>This is a strong sentence</strong>
    <b><br />This is a bold sentence</b>
    <p>
      Both sentences are looking same but the difference is while b is only
      visual, strong is not just visual it is also for screen readers to read
      with different tone
